Portable TIPC Test Suite for Linux README
       
Last updated: 19 September 2008


This directory contains the Linux edition of the portable TIPC test suite.


Directory contents
------------------
tipc_ts.h
tipc_ts_client.c
tipc_ts_server.c
tipc_ts_common.c
    OS-neutral test suite declarations and routines.

tipc_ts_adapt.h
tipc_ts_client_linux.c
tipc_ts_server_linux.c
    Linux wrapper code for invoking OS-neutral test suite code.

Makefile
    Makefile for building test suite.


Building the test suite
-----------------------
For a TIPC 1.6 (or later) installation, just do a normal build; the test suite
makefile should locate the necessary TIPC include files automatically.

eg. cd <top level test suite directory>
    make

If the TIPC include files are not properly located, find the directory that
contains the files linux/tipc.h and linux/tipc_config.h and specify this
directory in the make command:

eg. cd <top level demo directory>
    make INCLUDE_PATH=<path to directory containing linux/tipc.h>

Note: In the standard Linux kernel source tree, this directory is located
at <top of source tree>/include.


The build procedure produces two executables (tipcTC and tipcTS), representing
the "client" and "server" sides of the test suite.


Additional rules:

1) make clean		- deletes the test suite executables


Running the test suite
----------------------
The test suite is executed by running a test server and test client in tandem.
The client and server can be run on the same node or on different nodes
(including nodes running TIPC on different OS's).


To run the test server, use:
	./tipcTS

To run the test client, use:
	./tipcTC [-k] <test>
	
Normally only a single test is run; requesting test "0" runs all other tests
sequentially.  If the "-k" options is specified when the client is invoked
the test server will be terminated at the conclusion of the test(s); otherwise,
the test server will be left running so it can be used again by another client.

    NOTE: The client terminates all testing as soon as a failure is detected
    or when all requested tests have run to completion successfully.

To see additional options for these commands, use the "-h" option.


CAUTION
-------
This test suite is designed as a verification aid (i.e. indicating that a
problem exists), not a diagnostics aid (i.e. indicating the source of the
problem).  Consequently, the failure of a given test means only that there is a
problem with TIPC somewhere, not that the problem lies in the area being tested!
