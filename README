TIPC utilities package for Linux README

Last updated: 08 Aug 2012


This directory contains a variety of utility programs for use with Linux TIPC,
including:

1) tipc-config
An application for run-time configuration and monitoring of TIPC.

2) PTTS (Portable TIPC Test Suite)
A basic sanity test suite that can be used to verify that major aspects of TIPC
are operating correctly.

3) TIPC demos
A collection of demo programs.  The benchmark and inventory simulation demos
can be helpful in stressing certain aspects of TIPC beyond the areas covered
by PTTS.

4) TIPC pipe
A netcat like program for tipc.


Building the utilities package
------------------------------
The master makefile for the utilities package allows you to build all programs
in a single operation.  (If desired, you can also build a specific utility
individually from its own sub-directory.)

If you cloned out the git repo you will need to run

   ./bootstrap

first, if you have the dist tarball you need only run:

    ./configure
    make

If the TIPC include files are not properly located, find the directory that
contains the files linux/tipc.h and linux/tipc_config.h and specify this
directory in the configure stage:

    ./configure  CFLAGS=-I<path to directory containing linux/tipc.h>

Note: In the standard Linux kernel source tree, this directory is located
at <top of source tree>/include.

The build procedure produces executable programs in the various sub-directories
that make up the package.


TIPC utilities uses autoconf and automake, to customize your build please
see the autotools and automake manuals. A few common targets are

    make install
    make dist


Running the utilities package
-----------------------------
Consult the README file in each sub-directory for further details on using
the associated application.
